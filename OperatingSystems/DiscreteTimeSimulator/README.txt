To run the simulator simply save the project folder in and open its directory in command line.

This project was coded and compiled on Python 3.7.2 and will be ran with command python3.

Once directory is open, run the command "sh dts_script.sh".

It will take some time to run and will notify you when each new scheduler starts.

This will create a results.txt file that should contain data closely related to the data in results.xlsx

The results.xlsx file contains a copy of the data from one of my own runs.

The data will be explained and interpreted in results_report.doc.

Really good project Professor Guirguis. I really enjoyed it and I learned a lot.
