Hey guys.

Basically I think these are for the most part going to be the classes we will use to create the project.
**NOTE:THIS IS DEFINITELY SUBJECT TO CHANGE

Im holidng off on writing parts for the SDD and the test template because its been a minute since Ive coded in Java.

After trying to attempt this on my own for about a day and a half I think the best shot is that we all make sure we are ok with this basis for 
what to code. Divvy out who gets to code what, and then go in and update the SDD as we go individually for each class and the SDD.

Ive gotten the SDD basically started to where I think we should be able to continue from where I think we can.
I hopefully think yall can get an idea of exactly how all this should work from what Ive done so far too

We will talk about this more and I will go everything we i see you in class.
